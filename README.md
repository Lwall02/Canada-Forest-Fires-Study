# An analysis of global wildfire frequency and intensity from 2012 to 2022

## Overview

We examine data about global wildfires frequency and intensity over the last ten years, along with several predicting factors like precipitation, carbon dioxide levels, sea level, population, global temperature, etc. We estimate a model which explains the best predicting factors of wildfires and the trends in the frequency of fires for the next five years.
We then analyze some reasons for these observations. 

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `input/data` contains the data sources used in analysis including the raw data each statistic.
-   `outputs/data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `outputs/paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.
